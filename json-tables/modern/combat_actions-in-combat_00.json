This column indicates whether the action itself, not moving, provokes an attack\nof opportunity .  2 If the object is being held, carried, or worn by a creature, yes. If not, no.  3 If the character has a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, he or she can combine this action with a regular move. If the character has the Two-Weapon\nFighting feat, he or she can draw two light or one-handed weapons in the time it would normally take to draw one.  4 These attack forms substitute for a melee attack, not an action. As melee attacks, they can be used once in an attack or charge action, one or more times in a full attack action, or even as an attack of opportunity.  5 The description of a feat defines its effect."
