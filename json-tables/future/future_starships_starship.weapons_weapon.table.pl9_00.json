Resetting the weapon to its original configuration requires another check and another hour of labor.  2 The purchase DC includes a basic launch system (missile rack or missile tube) and eight missiles with warheads. The purchase DC is 2 lower without the launch system.  3 In addition to taking damage, the ship is dazed for 1 round (see Starship Condition Summary).  4 This weapon\u0092s damage ignores a ship\u0092s hardness."
