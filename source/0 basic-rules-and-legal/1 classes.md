to advance with no set path or pre-determined class features

### Class Features

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A Hero may gain proficiency with any available weapon, be they modern, or primitive and with any type of armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields whether archaic or ballistic. This is, of course, bounded by availability and strength limitations.
