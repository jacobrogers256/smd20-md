Animated objects come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. They owe their
existence as creatures to spells such as *animate objects *or similar
supernatural abilities.

COMBAT

Animated objects fight only as directed by the animator. They follow
orders without question and to the best of their abilities. Since they
do not need to breathe and never tire, they can be extremely capable
minions.

An animated object can have one or more of the following special
abilities, depending on its form.

**Blind (Ex):** A sheetlike animated object such as a carpet or tapestry
can grapple an opponent up to three sizes larger than itself. The object
makes a normal grapple check. If it wins, it wraps itself around the
opponent’s head, causing that creature to be blinded until removed.

**Constrict (Ex): **A flexible animated object such as a rope, vine, or
rug deals damage equal to its slam damage value plus 1- 1/2 times its
Strength bonus with a successful grapple check against a creature up to
one size larger than itself.

An object of at least Large size can make constriction attacks against
multiple creatures at once, if they all are at least two sizes smaller
than the object and can fit under it.

**Hardness (Ex): **An animated object has the same hardness it had
before it was animated.

**Improved Speed (Ex):** The base land speed given in the statistics
block assume that an animated object lurches, rocks, or slithers along.

Objects with two legs (statues, ladders) or a similar shape that allows
faster movement have a +10 foot bonus to speed. Objects with multiple
legs (tables, chairs) have a +20 foot bonus to speed. Wheeled objects
have a +40 foot bonus to speed.

Objects might have additional modes of movement. A wooden object can
float and has a swim speed equal to half its land speed. A rope or
similar sinuous object has a climb speed equal to half its land speed. A
sheetlike object can fly (clumsy maneuverability) at half its normal
speed.

**Trample (Ex): **An animated object of at least Large size and with a
hardness of at least 10 can trample creatures two or more sizes smaller
than itself, dealing damage equal to the object’s slam damage + 1-1/2
times its Strength bonus. Opponents who do not make attacks of
opportunity against the object can attempt Reflex saves (DC 10 + 1/2
object’s HD + object’s Str modifier) to halve the damage.

DINOSAUR

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Bigger varieties have drab
coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have more colorful markings. Most
dinosaurs have a pebbly skin texture.

COMBAT

Dinosaurs take full advantage of their size and speed. The swift
carnivores stalk prey, staying hidden in cover until they can get into
charge range and rush to the attack. Herbivores frequently overrun and
trample their opponents.

A deinonychus is bright green along its back and flanks, with a much
lighter shade of the same color on its underside. The body has darker
spots or stripes. Its tail extends straight out behind itself, held
aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its
weight to be carried entirely by the back legs. It weighs about 600
pounds.

Combat

A deinonychus uses a combination of speed, grasping forearms, large
teeth, and hind legs with ripping talons. It hunts by running at prey,
leaping, and ripping with its rear talons as it claws and bites. The
talons count as one attack. A deinonychus has a relatively large brain
for a dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics.

**Pounce (Ex):** If a deinonychus charges, it can make a full attack.

**Skills:** A deinonychus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Jump, Listen,
Spot, and Survival checks.

Though it resides primarily in the water, an elasmosaurus only breathes
air. An elasmosaurus has a total length of some 30 feet, including a
tail half as long as its entire body, and weighs about 5,000 pounds.
Observers who see only its head or tail might easily mistake it for a
massive snake.

Combat

An elasmosaurus is aggressive and attacks anything it notices. The
creature is strong, fast, and highly maneuverable, able to turn quickly
and lunge at prey. When hunting, it travels with its head out of the
water, snapping down quickly to seize prey.

**Skills:** \*An elasmosaurus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in
water.

Despite its enormous size and 6-ton weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift
runner. Its head is nearly 6 feet long, and its teeth are from 3 to 6
inches in length. It is slightly more than 30 feet long from nose to
tail.

Combat

A tyrannosaurus pursues and eats just about anything it sees. Its
tactics are simple—charge in and bite.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a tyrannosaurus must hit an
opponent of up to one size smaller with its bite attack. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
can try to swallow the foe the following round.

**Swallow Whole (Ex): **A tyrannosaurus can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of up to two sizes smaller by making a successful grapple
check. The swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage
and 8 points of acid damage per round from the tyrannosaurus’s gizzard.
A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or
piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 12). Once
the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out.

A Huge tyrannosaurus’s gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or
128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.

**Skills: **A tyrannosaurus has a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt
fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the dire wolf.

Silently, and Spot checks.
