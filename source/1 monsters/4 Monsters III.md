SWARM

Swarms are dense masses of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that
would not be particularly dangerous in small groups, but can be terrible
foes when gathered in sufficient numbers. For game purposes a swarm is
defined as a single creature with a space of 10 feet—gigantic hordes are
actually composed of dozens of swarms in close proximity. A swarm has a
single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a
single speed, and a single Armor Class. It makes saving throws as a
single creature.

Many different creatures can mass as swarms; bat swarms, centipede
swarms, hellwasp swarms, locust swarms, rat swarms, and spider swarms
are described here. The swarm’s type varies with the nature of the
component creature (most are animals or vermin), but all swarms have the
swarm subtype.

A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000
flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500
nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures
consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of
nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit
in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a
swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other
and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented
by multiples of single swarms. A large swarm is completely shapeable,
though it usually remains contiguous.

COMBAT

In order to attack, a single swarm moves into opponents’ spaces, which
provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a
creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey, but remains a
creature with a 10-foot space. Swarms never make attacks of opportunity,
but they can provoke attacks of opportunity.

Unlike other creatures with a 10-foot space, a swarm is shapeable. It
can occupy any four contiguous squares, and it can squeeze through any
space large enough to contain one of its component creatures.

Vulnerabilities of Swarms

Swarms are extremely difficult to fight with physical attacks. However,
they have a few special vulnerabilities,

as follows:

A lit torch swung as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of fire
damage per hit.

A weapon with a special ability such as flaming or frost deals its full
energy damage with each hit, even if the weapon’s normal damage can’t
affect the swarm.

A lit lantern can be used as a thrown weapon, dealing 1d4 points of fire
damage to all creatures in squares adjacent to where it breaks.

A bat swarm is nocturnal, and is never found aboveground in daylight.

Combat

A bat swarm seeks to surround and attack any warm-blooded prey it
encounters. The swarm deals 1d6 points of damage to any creature whose
space it occupies at the end of its move.

**Distraction (Ex): **Any living creature that begins its turn with a
swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude save or be
nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Wounding (Ex):** Any living creature damaged by a bat swarm continues
to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do
not result in cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a
DC 10 Heal check or the application of a *cure *spell or some other
healing magic.

**Blindsense (Ex):** A bat swarm notices and locates creatures within 20
feet. Opponents still have total concealment against the bat swarm (but
swarm attacks ignore concealment).

**Skills:** A bat swarm has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
These bonuses are lost if its blindsense is negated.

A locust swarm is a cloud of thousands of winged vermin that devours any
organic material in its path.

Combat

A locust swarm surrounds and attacks any living prey it encounters. A
swarm deals 2d6 points of damage to any creature whose space it occupies
at the end of its move.

**Distraction (Ex): **Any living creature that begins its turn with a
locust swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be
nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Skills:** A locust swarm has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot

Combat

A rat swarm seeks to surround and attack any warm-blooded prey it
encounters. A swarm deals 1d6 points of damage to any creature whose
space it occupies at the end of its move.

**Disease (Ex):** Filth fever—swarm attack, Fortitude DC 12, incubation
period 1d3 days, damage 1d3 Dex and 1d3 Con. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

**Distraction (Ex):** Any living creature that begins its turn with a
swarm in its square must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be
nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Skills: **A rat swarm has a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently
checks, and a +8 racial bonus on Balance, Climb, and Swim checks. A rat
swarm can always choose to take 10 on all Climb checks, even if rushed
or threatened. A rat swarm uses its Dexterity modifier instead of its
Strength modifier for Climb and Swim checks. A rat swarm has a +8 racial
bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a
hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if
distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming,
provided it swims in a straight line.
