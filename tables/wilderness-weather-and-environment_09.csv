"1 A creature without a freedom of movement effects or a swim speed makes grapple checks underwater at
            a –2 penalty, but deals damage normally when grappling."
"2 A successful Swim check lets a creature move one-quarter its speed as a move action or one-half its speed
            as a full-round action."
"3 Creatures have firm footing when walking along the bottom, braced against a ship’s hull, or the like. A
            creature can only walk along the bottom if it wears or carries enough gear to weigh itself down—at least 16
            pounds for Medium creatures, twice that for each size category larger than Medium, and half that for each
            size category smaller than Medium."
"4 Creatures flailing about in the water (usually because they failed their Swim checks) have a hard time
            fighting effectively. An off-balance creature loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and opponents gain a
            +2 bonus on attacks against it."
