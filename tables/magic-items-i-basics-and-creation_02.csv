"1 Rods usable as weapons must include the masterwork weapon cost."
"2 This cost is only for spells activated by the item that have material or XP components. Having a spell
            with a costly component as a prerequisite does not automatically incur this cost if the item doesn’t
            actually cast the spell."
"3 If purchasing a staff, the buyer pays 5 x the XP value in gold pieces."
"4 A character creating an item pays 1/25 the base price in experience points."
