"50","Lift a sheathed weapon from another creature and hide it on the character’s person, if the weapon is no more
            than one size category larger than the character’s own size."
"80","Make an adjacent, willing creature or object of the character’s size or smaller “disappear” while in plain
            view. In fact, the willing creature or object is displaced up to 10 feet away—make a separate Hide check to
            determine how well the “disappeared” creature or object is hidden."
