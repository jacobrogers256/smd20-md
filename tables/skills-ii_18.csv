"Tumble DC","Task"
"15","Treat a fall as if it were 10 feet shorter than it really is when determining damage."
"15","Tumble at one-half speed as part of normal movement, provoking no attacks of opportunity while doing so.
              Failure means you provoke attacks of opportunity normally. Check separately for each opponent you move
              past, in the order in which you pass them (playerâ€™s choice of order in case of a tie).  Each additional enemy after the first adds +2 to the Tumble DC."
"25","Tumble at one-half speed through an area occupied by an enemy (over, under, or around the opponent) as
              part of normal movement, provoking no attacks of opportunity while doing so. Failure means you stop before
              entering the enemy-occupied area and provoke an attack of opportunity from that enemy.  Check separately for each opponent. Each additional enemy after the first adds +2 to the Tumble DC."
