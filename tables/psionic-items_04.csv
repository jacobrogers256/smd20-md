"1 Add to enhancement bonus to determine total market price."
"2 Reroll if you get a duplicate special ability, an ability incompatible with an ability that you’ve already
            rolled, or if the extra ability puts you over the +10 limit. A weapon’s enhancement bonus and special
            ability bonus equivalents can’t total more than +10."
