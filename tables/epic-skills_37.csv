"Poison’s DC + 5","When poisoned, the character can make an Autohypnosis check on his or her next action. A successful check
            indicates the character does not have to make a saving throw against the poison’s secondary damage, which he
            or she instead automatically ignores."
"50","If a failed saving throw indicates the character is affected by any mind-affecting powers, spells, or
            spell-like effects, a successful Autohypnosis check allows an immediate second saving throw to resist the
            effect. If the mind-affecting effect normally does not allow a saving throw, a successful Autohypnosis check
            allows a saving throw."
"60","With a successful Autohypnosis check, the character gains temporary hit points equal to 10 + his or her
              Wisdom modifier. The temporary hit points persist until lost. A character cannot check for temporary hit
              points more than once per day. Temporary hit points gained through Autohypnosis do not stack with
              temporary hit points gained through any other source"
