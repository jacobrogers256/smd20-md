"1 The siege weapon category includes ballista and catapult attacks as well as boulders tossed by giants."
"2 Flying or airborne creatures are treated as one size category smaller than their actual size, so an
            airborne Gargantuan dragon is treated as Huge for purposes of wind effects."
"Checked: Creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind. Flying creatures are
            blown back 1d6×5 feet."
"Knocked Down: Creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are instead
            blown back 1d6×10 feet."
"Blown Away: Creatures on the ground are knocked prone and rolled 1d4×10 feet, taking 1d4 points of
            nonlethal damage per 10 feet. Flying creatures are blown back 2d6×10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal
            damage due to battering and buffeting."
