"1 Quadrupeds, such as horses, can carry heavier loads than characters can. See Carrying Capacity, above, for
            more information."
"2 Rafts, barges, keelboats, and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers.  If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the
              vehicle. In addition to 10 hours of being rowed, the vehicle can also float an additional 14 hours, if
              someone can guide it, so add an additional 42 miles to the daily distance traveled. These vehicles can’t
              be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores."
