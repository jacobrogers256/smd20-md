"1 Add to enhancement bonus on Table: Weapons to determine total market price."
"2 Masterwork double weapons incur double the masterwork cost to account for each head (+300 gp masterwork
            cost per head for a total of +600 gp). Double weapons have separate magical bonuses for their different
            heads. If randomly determined, the second head of a double weapon has the same enhancement bonus as the main
            head (01–50 on d%), doubling the cost of the bonus, or its enhancement bonus is one less (51–100) and it has
            no special abilities. All magic weapons are masterwork weapons."
