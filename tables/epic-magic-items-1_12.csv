"All magic weapons are masterwork weapons."
"1 For weapons normally made of steel, roll d% to determine material: 01–85 steel; 86–99 adamantine; 100
            other. Adjust price accordingly."
"2 Add to enhancement bonus on Table: Weapons to determine total market price."
"3 Masterwork double weapons incur double the masterwork cost to account for each head (+300 gp masterwork
            cost per head for a total of +600 gp). Double weapons have separate bonuses for their different heads. If
            randomly determined, the second head of a double weapon has the same enhancement bonus as the main head
            (01–50 on d%), doubling the cost of the bonus, or its enhancement bonus is one less (51–100 on d%) and it
            has no special abilities."
