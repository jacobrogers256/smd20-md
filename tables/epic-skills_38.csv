"30","If reduced to negative hit points but not dead, make a Stabilize Self check. If successful, the character
            does not go unconscious and can continue taking actions until he or she bleeds to death or stabilizes (the
            character can also continue making stabilization checks). If healed or stabilized, the character continues
            to take actions normally."
"60","On a successful Stabilize Self check, the character gains damage reduction 2/â€“. The damage reduction lasts
            for 12 hours. The character cannot check for damage reduction more than once per day. Damage reduction
            gained through Stabilize Self does not stack with damage reduction gained through any other source."
