"1 Regardless of the action, if you move out of a threatened square, you usually provoke an attack of
            opportunity. This column indicates whether the action itself, not moving, provokes an attack of opportunity."
"2 If you aid someone performing an action that would normally provoke an attack of opportunity, then the act
            of aiding another provokes an attack of opportunity as well."
"3 If the object is being held, carried, or worn by a creature, yes. If not, no."
"4 If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you can combine one of these actions with a regular move.
            If you have the Two- Weapon Fighting feat, you can draw two light or one-handed weapons in the time it would
            normally take you to draw one."
"5 May be taken as a standard action if you are limited to taking only a single action in a round."
"6 Unless the component is an extremely large or awkward item."
"7 These attack forms substitute for a melee attack, not an action. As melee attacks, they can be used once
            in an attack or charge action, one or more times in a full attack action, or even as an attack of
            opportunity."
"8 The description of a feat defines its effect."
