### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the fighter.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency: **A fighter is proficient with all
simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light)
and shields (including tower shields).

**Bonus Feats:** At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented
feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the
bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional
bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th,
6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus feats
must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats. A fighter
must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability
score and base attack bonus minimums.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any
class gets from advancing levels. A fighter is not limited to the list
of fighter bonus feats when choosing these feats.
