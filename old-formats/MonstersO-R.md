A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. These
enormous creatures are 30 feet long from the beak to the base of the
tail, with wingspans as wide as 80 feet. A roc weighs about 8,000
pounds.

COMBAT

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its
powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. A
solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any Medium or larger
creature that appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert,
fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings.

**Skills:** Rocs have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.
