MONSTERS (Di-Do)

DINOSAUR

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Bigger varieties have drab
coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have more colorful markings. Most
dinosaurs have a pebbly skin texture.

COMBAT

Dinosaurs take full advantage of their size and speed. The swift
carnivores stalk prey, staying hidden in cover until they can get into
charge range and rush to the attack. Herbivores frequently overrun and
trample their opponents.

A deinonychus is bright green along its back and flanks, with a much
lighter shade of the same color on its underside. The body has darker
spots or stripes. Its tail extends straight out behind itself, held
aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its
weight to be carried entirely by the back legs. It weighs about 600
pounds.

Combat

A deinonychus uses a combination of speed, grasping forearms, large
teeth, and hind legs with ripping talons. It hunts by running at prey,
leaping, and ripping with its rear talons as it claws and bites. The
talons count as one attack. A deinonychus has a relatively large brain
for a dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics.

**Pounce (Ex):** If a deinonychus charges, it can make a full attack.

**Skills:** A deinonychus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Jump, Listen,
Spot, and Survival checks.

Though it resides primarily in the water, an elasmosaurus only breathes
air. An elasmosaurus has a total length of some 30 feet, including a
tail half as long as its entire body, and weighs about 5,000 pounds.
Observers who see only its head or tail might easily mistake it for a
massive snake.

Combat

An elasmosaurus is aggressive and attacks anything it notices. The
creature is strong, fast, and highly maneuverable, able to turn quickly
and lunge at prey. When hunting, it travels with its head out of the
water, snapping down quickly to seize prey.

**Skills:** \*An elasmosaurus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in
water.

Despite its enormous size and 6-ton weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift
runner. Its head is nearly 6 feet long, and its teeth are from 3 to 6
inches in length. It is slightly more than 30 feet long from nose to
tail.

Combat

A tyrannosaurus pursues and eats just about anything it sees. Its
tactics are simple—charge in and bite.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a tyrannosaurus must hit an
opponent of up to one size smaller with its bite attack. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
can try to swallow the foe the following round.

**Swallow Whole (Ex): **A tyrannosaurus can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of up to two sizes smaller by making a successful grapple
check. The swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage
and 8 points of acid damage per round from the tyrannosaurus’s gizzard.
A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or
piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 12). Once
the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out.

A Huge tyrannosaurus’s gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or
128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.

**Skills: **A tyrannosaurus has a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

Dire wolves are efficient pack hunters that will kill anything they can
catch.

Dire wolves are mottled gray or black, about 9 feet long and weighing
some 800 pounds.

Combat

Dire wolves prefer to attack in packs, surrounding and flanking a foe
when they can.

**Trip (Ex):** A dire wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to
trip its opponent (+11 check modifier) as a free action without making a
touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt
fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the dire wolf.

**Skills:** A dire wolf has a +2 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move
Silently, and Spot checks.

\*It also has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by
scent.
